venue: useR! 2024, Salzburg, Austria
github: FinYang/roam
abstract: The "roam" package simplifies the creation of R objects that resemble regular objects but are sourced from remote locations. It empowers package developers to incorporate these "roaming" objects, which may surpass the 5MB limit, into their packages. Additionally, it facilitates dataset updates independent of package updates through functions that retrieve data from remote sources.
