## Hi

My name is Yangzhuoran Yang, but usually I let people call me **Fin** since that's easier if you don't speak Chinese.


I just finished my PhD at Monash University under the supervision of [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/), [Professor George Athanasopoulos](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/george-athanasopoulos), and [Professor Anastasios Panagiotelis](https://anastasiospanagiotelis.netlify.app/), focusing on the use of components in time series forecasting. I‚Äôve started my postdoc with [Associate Professor Ines Wilms](https://sites.google.com/view/iwilms/homepage) in the Department of Quantitative Economics at Maastricht University. 

Recently I have been thinking about the mismatch between the assumption of forecasting models and the DGP itself, and how this can be mitigated by the post-forecast adjustment process. In the long run, I hope to study more about methods and theories that assume less but still provide practical guidance for our understanding of time series forecasting. 

I am a frequent [R package writer](/software/). I have also been [teaching](/teaching/) for a while.
