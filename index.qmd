## Hi

My name is Yangzhuoran Yang, but usually I let people call me **Fin** since that's easier if you don't speak Chinese.


I am now close to finishing my PhD after a much-hated covid halt (during which I was practising amateur applied economics). My PhD is about using components in time series forecasting, under the supervision of [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/), [Professor George Athanasopoulos](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/george-athanasopoulos), and [Assoc Professor Anastasios Panagiotelis](https://anastasiospanagiotelis.netlify.app/)

Recently I have been thinking about the mismatch between the assumption of forecasting models and the DGP itself, and how this can be mitigated by the post-forecast adjustment process. In the long run, I hope to study more about methods and theories that assume less but still provide practical guidance for our understanding of time series forecasting. 

I am a frequent [R package writer](/software/). I have also been [teaching](/teaching/) for a while (but now finally getting some break).
