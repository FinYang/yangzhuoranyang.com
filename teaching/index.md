## ETC3410 - Applied Econometrics

## Private tutoring

I did private tutoring for a couple of years, covering Introduction to Econometrics, Probability and Statistical Inference for Economics and Business, Actuarial Statistics, Applied Econometrics and Financial Econometrics. Some of the old materials I used can be found [here](/materials/). I actually spent quite some time on them.
