# Software

The R packages/Shiny apps I've contributed to. All of them are on GitHub and some of them are on CRAN.

## Regression Estimation

* [RRRR](https://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/RRRR): Methods for estimating online robust reduced-rank regression. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RRRR)]

## Time series analysis and forecasting

* [flap](https://github.com/FinYang/flap): Forecast Linear Augmented Projection method that can reduce forecast erro variance. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=flap)] 
* [tsfeatures](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/tsfeatures/): Time Series Feature Extraction. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=tsfeatures)] 

## Time series data 
* [Mcomp](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/Mcomp): The 1001 time series from the M-competition (Makridakis et al. 1982) and the 3003 time series from the IJF-M3 competition (Makridakis and Hibon, 2000). [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=Mcomp)]   
* [tscompdata](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/tscompdata/): Time Series Competition Data   
* [tsdl](https://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/tsdl/): Time Series Data Library
* [compenginets](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/compenginets/): Time series data from CompEngine database.

## Demography

* [demography](https://github.com/robjhyndman/demography): Provides a large number of functions for handling demographic statistics, modelling and forecasting. In particular, it implements lifetable calculations; Lee-Carter modelling and variants; functional data analysis of mortality rates, fertility rates, net migration numbers; and stochastic population forecasting. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=demography)] 

## Non-parametric estimation

* [ycevo](https://github.com/bonsook/ycevo): Provides a range of functions to facilitate the non-parametric estimation of the discount rate, and yield curve, of CRSP Bond Data. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ycevo)]

## R Toolbox

* [roam](https://github.com/FinYang/roam): Remote Objects with Active-Binding Magic. Simplifying the creation of R objects that resemble regular objects but are sourced from remote locations.

* [lazytype](http://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/lazytype/): Provides addins for inserting code and running code in a different manner, and functions to allow interaction between scripts and between script and rmarkdown file.

* [lazybar](https://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/lazybar/): A simple Progress Bar showing estimated remaining time. Multiple forecast methods and user defined forecast method for the remaining time are supported. [[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lazybar)]

## Stochastic process  
* [stocon](https://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/stocon): Stochastic constrained optimization. (developing)

## Shiny app

* [LazyBib](https://finyang.shinyapps.io/lazybib/): Provides a simple interface to process .bib file, replacing repetitive manual works such as deleting certain fields for all entries, change to abbreviated journal names, etc. [[GitHub](https://github.com/FinYang/LazyBib)]
