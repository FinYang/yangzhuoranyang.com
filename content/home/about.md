# Hi

My name is Yangzhuoran Yang, but usually I let people call me __Fin__ as that's easier if you don't speak Chinese.

I did my Honours in Econometrics at Monash in 2019. The project I've been working on is about portfolio selection in a stochastic control setting with [Dr Bonsoo Koo](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/bonsoo-koo) and [Dr Dan Zhu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/dan-zhu). I am also working part-time for them as a research assistant. The works I've done are mostly related to R programming and data manipulation. You can find the software I have contributed [here](/software/).

I tutored Business statistics at [Southeast Universityâ€“Monash University Joint Graduate School](https://www.monash.edu/suzhou) in Suzhou for the 2020 November intake and 2021 Semester 1 of Master of Business and Master of Banking and Finance. 

I have been doing my PhD remotely. It is in hierarchical forecasting at Monash with [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/), [Professor George Athanasopoulos](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/george-athanasopoulos), and [Assoc Professor Anastasios Panagiotelis](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/anastasios-panagiotelis). 

I am now in Beijing, practicing amateur applied economics, experiment design and evaluation. Drop by and meet me if you have the chance.
