# Hi

My name is Yangzhuoran Yang, but usually I let people call me __Fin__ as that's easier if you don't speak Chinese.

I just finished my undergraduate degree. While waiting to begin Honours study at Monash (if they want me), I am currently working for [Dr Bonsoo Koo](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/bonsoo-koo), [Dr Dan Zhu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/dan-zhu) and [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/) as a research assistant. The works I've done are mostly related to R programming and data manipulation. One of the projects that I'm doing recently involves stochastic optimization. You can find the software I have contributed on this site.

Apart from that, I have also been doing some private tutoring on Econometrics related courses for a few years. I have a degree on Actuarial Science, but sadly I find Business analytics and Econometrics are more interesting to me.
