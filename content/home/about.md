# Hi

My name is Yangzhuoran Yang, but usually I let people call me __Fin__ as that's easier if you don't speak Chinese.


I did my Honours in Econometrics at Monash in 2019. The project I've been working on is about portfolio selection in a stochastic control setting with [Dr Bonsoo Koo](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/bonsoo-koo) and [Dr Dan Zhu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/dan-zhu). I am also working part-time for them as a research assistant. The works I've done are mostly related to R programming and data manipulation. You can find the software I have contributed [here](/software/).

I have done lab supervising for the unit of Business and economic statistics at Monash in 2019, and some private tutoring on Econometrics related courses for a few years. I would have also done Applied econometrics if not for COVID-19.


I have been doing my PhD remotely. It is in hierarchical forecasting at Monash with [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/), [Professor George Athanasopoulos](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/george-athanasopoulos), and [Assoc Professor Anastasios Panagiotelis](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/anastasios-panagiotelis). 

I just worked on [some optimisation problem](/project/rrrr/) with [Professor Ziping Zhao](http://zipingzhao.github.io/) at [ShanghaiTech SIST](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/). I am now in Suzhou, tutoring Business statistics at [Southeast Universityâ€“Monash University Joint Graduate School](https://www.monash.edu/suzhou) for the November intake of Master of Business and Master of Banking and Finance. More information can be found [here](https://www.monash.edu/study/nov-intake-2020).
