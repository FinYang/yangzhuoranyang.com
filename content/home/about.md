# Hi

My name is Yangzhuoran Yang, but usually I let people call me __Fin__ as that's easier if you don't speak Chinese.


I did my Honours in Econometrics at Monash in 2019. The project I've been working on is about portfolio selection in a stochastic control setting with [Dr Bonsoo Koo](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/bonsoo-koo) and [Dr Dan Zhu](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/dan-zhu). I am also working part-time for them as a research assistant. The works I've done are mostly related to R programming and data manipulation. You can find the software I have contributed [here](/software/).

I have also done lab supervising for the unit of Business and economic statistics at Monash in 2019, and some private tutoring on Econometrics related courses for a few years. In 2020 I will be tutoring Applied Econometrics. 


I am current working on [some optimisation problem](/project/rrrr/) with [Professor Ziping Zhao](http://zipingzhao.github.io/) at [ShanghaiTech SIST](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/). If you haven't heard about the uni, it's a relatively new uni in Shanghai, and it's really good. This work has produced a reduced-rank regression estimation package [RRRR](https://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/RRRR/), a conference paper and an upcoming talk at [IEEE SAM 2020](http://www.sam2020.cn/).

I am still stuck here in China because of the coronavirus, but I'm gonna start my PhD anyway, otherwise it's gonna be a threat to both my body and sanity. My PhD is going to be in hierarchical forecasting at Monash with [Professor Rob J. Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/), [Professor George Athanasopoulos](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/george-athanasopoulos), and [Assoc Professor Anastasios Panagiotelis](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/anastasios-panagiotelis).
