The R packages/Shiny apps I've contributed. All of them are on GitHub and some of them are on CRAN.

## Shiny app

* [LazyBib](https://finyang.shinyapps.io/lazybib/): Provides a simple interface to process .bib file, replacing repetitive manual works such as deleting certain fields for all entries, change to abbreviated journal names, etc. [[GitHub](https://github.com/FinYang/LazyBib)]

## Non-parametric estimation

* [ycevo](https://github.com/FinYang/ycevo): Provides a range of functions to facilitate the non-parametric estimation of the discount rate, and yield curve, of CRSP Bond Data. (CRAN coming soon)

## Time series analysis packages  
* [tsfeatures](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/tsfeatures/): Time Series Feature Extraction. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=tsfeatures)] 

## Time series data packages  
* [Mcomp](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/Mcomp): The 1001 time series from the M-competition (Makridakis et al. 1982) and the 3003 time series from the IJF-M3 competition (Makridakis and Hibon, 2000). [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=Mcomp)]   
* [tscompdata](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/tscompdata/): Time Series Competition Data   
* [tsdl](https://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/tsdl/): Time Series Data Library
* [compenginets](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/compenginets/): Time series data from CompEngine database.

## Demography package

* [demography](https://github.com/robjhyndman/demography): Provides a large number of functions for handling demographic statistics, modelling and forecasting. In particular, it implements lifetable calculations; Lee-Carter modelling and variants; functional data analysis of mortality rates, fertility rates, net migration numbers; and stochastic population forecasting. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=demography)] 

## Stochastic process  
* [stocon](https://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/stocon): Stochastic constrained optimization. (developing)

## R Toolbox

* [lazytype](http://pkg.yangzhuoranyang.com/lazytype/): Provides addins for inserting code and running code in a different manner, and functions to allow interaction between scripts and between script and rmarkdown file.
